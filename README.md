# Some nice basic CSS

Sometimes you want some basics to play around with or use for a demo. I’ve got your back.

It’s designed to work with the [Modern CSS Reset](https://github.com/hankchizljaw/some-nice-basic-css).

## Getting started

You can go ahead and copy the CSS if you want. It all lives in `global.css`. You can also use it from a CDN like this:

Unpkg CDN:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/some-nice-basic-css/global.css" />
```

jsDelivr CDN:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/some-nice-basic-css/global.css" />
```

I guess you can also use npm if you want, too.

## Licence

Good ol’ MIT licence going on here so enjoy yourself and do what you want.

## Contributing

No thanks. I’m just sharing this so people can use it. I’ll just close PRs and stuff. Life is too short to maintain another OS project.

By all means, go ahead and fork it and do what you want though!
